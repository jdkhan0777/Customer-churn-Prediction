# Customer-churn-Prediction
 Built and optimized churn prediction models for telecom customer data using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, boosting churn recall by 278% (from 9% to 34%) through SMOTE balancing.

 Conducted full-cycle data science project including EDA, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and business insight generation for real-world client datasets.

 Identified key churn drivers such as high monthly charges, fiber optic service, and lack of online support, enabling more targeted retention strategies.
 Engineered custom features like TotalSpend and AverageMonthlyCost, and applied advanced encoding and outlier detection to improve model performance.

Evaluated models using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix, selecting Gradient Boosting + SMOTE as the best-performing solution with 0.35 F1-score for churn.

 Created a reusable machine learning pipeline in Jupyter Notebooks with modular steps for preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and visualization.

 Technologies used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib, Google Colab
